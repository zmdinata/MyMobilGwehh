"""Finish member calls that cross a repository boundary in a merged graph (#3152).

A single-repo build can only bind ``obj.method()`` when the receiver's type is
declared in that same build. When the type lives in another repository the
resolver holds the receiver type and drops the call anyway, so ``graph.json`` —
the only artifact ``merge-graphs`` and ``global add`` consume — records nothing,
and no merge-time pass can recover what was never written down. A two-repo call
graph was therefore missing exactly the edges that make it a call graph: eight
edges when the code sits in one corpus, seven after merging the same code from
two repos.

The resolvers now park those calls on the caller node as
``metadata.unresolved_calls`` entries (names only, no node ids — see
``_park_unresolved_member_call``). This pass reads them back after the graphs are
composed and emits the ``calls`` edge when the receiver's type resolves to
exactly one declaration in another repo, keeping the single-definition guard the
single-repo resolvers use: an ambiguous name still fabricates nothing.

Edges only, no node merging or renaming, so the pass composes with the prefixing
and pruning already in place. Every edge it adds is tagged, and it clears its own
previous output before recomputing: ``global add`` composes one repo at a time
and revisits the same pairs on every add, and recomputing from the parked entries
keeps the result identical whether three repos arrived together or one at a time.
